This PowerShell script is for people who want easy acess to know news headlines, And also has a local Sign Up/Login "page"
Please Read: Please don't try to delete the file titled: psnp.txt, This file contains the usernames and passwords to tell the PowerShell script to save them, Kind of like a local database, if you remove or move the .txt file a part of the PowerShell script will break.
So please don't try to delete or move the .txt file and also download it with the PowerShell script for it to also work.
Sincerly
